          visit certain pages of our website and the cookie has not expired,
          Google and we recognize that you have clicked on the ad and forwarded

        <p className='mb-4 leading-relaxed text-justify'>
          Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The

          conversion tracking. Customers can see the total number of Users who
          clicked on their ad and were forwarded to a conversion tracking tag.
          However, they do not receive any information that allows Users to be
          personally identified.
